    <p>
      Where do I even begin with my wife, Alicia? She is the kindest, sweetest,
      and most selfless person I have ever known. Throughout every endeavor I’ve
      pursued — whether I succeeded or stumbled — she has supported me
      wholeheartedly. She is my unwavering rock, and I truly would not be the
      person I am today without her by my side. &hearts;

    <h2>Simon</h2>

    <p>
      Simon is the baby of the family and the newest addition. He is a sweet and
      funloving dog that always wants to play and go outside and anytime anyone
      drives in the car. He truly has changed all of our lives and we love him
      so much!

  <h2>Steve</h2>
  <img src="/images/bubby.jpeg" alt="image of steve the cat" width="150" />
  <p>
    Steve, Bubby, Bubbs. He is the golden goose (don't tell the others!) He is
    the pride and joy of our household and is unlike any other cat in the world.
    He loves us so much and we love him even more. He will forever be the best
    animal we have ever gotten the opprotunity to love &hearts;
  </p>

  <h2>Sunni</h2>
  <img src="/images/image2.jpeg" alt="image of Sunni the cat" height="175" />
  <p>
    Sunni, Sunni-Bun-Bun. He is our little field rescue "rat" and he is the
    personality of the house. He has never met a stranger and rubs up on anyone
    that will make eyecontact with him. He is Simon's best fried and those two
    are always getting into trouble!
  </p>

  <h2>Sammie</h2>
  <img src="/images/image4.jpeg" alt="Sammie the cat" height="150" />
  <p>
    Ol' Sam-Squirrel. As the image suggests, she goes to the beat of her own
    drum. She is our Prissy little girl that does what she wants, when she
    wants. She is a Queen among peasants and she has no problem reminding that
    to you if you attempt to pick her up!
