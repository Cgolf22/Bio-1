    <h2>The Spark</h2>
    <p>
      From an early age, I developed a strong passion for technology, inspired
      by my first experiences with devices such as the Game Boy, early cell
      phones, and, most notably, computers and the internet. This curiosity
      drove me to continuously seek a deeper understanding of the field. In
      2023, I began working hands-on with hardware, which further fueled my
      interest in the broader scope of technology development. Motivated to
      expand my skills, I started learning to code in early 2025, embarking on a
      rewarding journey of professional growth. I am eager to continue building
      my expertise and excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.

      I began taking courses through

      and collaborating with fellow developers to build a strong foundation of
      knowledge, with a focus on understanding not just how to code, but why
      certain approaches and best practices are important. My goal has always
      been to make programming an integral part of who I am, rather than simply
      a means to a career or source of income. Since then, I have become
      proficient in a variety of programming languages, including:

    <h2>The Road to the Future</h2>
    <p>
      With these tools, I was able to look beyond the physical product and
      appreciate the underlying structure and intricacies that bring web pages
      to life. I recognized the attention to detail, the dedication, and the
      passion embedded within each creation. It became clear to me that this was
      something I wanted to contribute to — to help craft works that are not
      only functional but enduring, inspiring me to continually grow and refine
      my skills.

      With the support of my wife and family, I had a strong foundation to help
      me navigate the challenges and opportunities along this journey. Each
      experience — both positive and negative — played a crucial role in shaping
      who I am today and continues to guide me toward the future I am working to
      build.
    </p>

      I am enthusiastic about the future and committed to continuous learning
      and growth. With dedication and passion, I look forward to seeing where
      this journey will lead and the opportunities it will bring. &hearts;
