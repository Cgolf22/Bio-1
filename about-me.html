    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my life, I have been truly blessed with a family that has
      supported me and nurtured every hobby and passion I’ve come to love. I was
      fortunate to have not just one, but two sets of parents who made sure I
      was cared for and able to fully enjoy my childhood. Today, I am even more
      blessed to share my life with my amazing wife, Alicia, and our four
      beloved fur-babies. I look forward with excitement and gratitude as our
      little family continues to grow, and I can't wait to pass on the same
      love, support, and blessings that I was so lucky to receive.

    <h2>Golf</h2>
    <p>
      Since the age of seven, I have been immersed in the game of golf — a sport
      that challenges both the body and the mind, requiring physical skill,
      mental toughness, and quick problem-solving. Over the years, playing on
      countless courses has allowed me to experience new places, meet wonderful
      people, and create lasting memories. Golf is a beautiful game that no one
      can ever truly master, yet we continue to chase perfection from childhood
      all the way through our golden years — and that journey is part of what
      makes it so special to me.

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>
      Growing up, video games were my gateway into the world of technology and
      all its little quirks. Whether it was mastering the latest game,
      troubleshooting when things inevitably went wrong, or just wondering how
      it all worked behind the scenes, I was hooked. Fast forward to today — and
      not much has changed! I still love diving into video games and seeing how
      far they’ve come. From solo adventures to chaotic online battle royales
      and sprawling MMORPGs, the possibilities are endless — and I’m always
      ready to jump in and try them all!

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for technology has been a lifelong pursuit, steadily growing
      over the years. From gaming and building my own computer from the ground
      up to troubleshooting both hardware and software issues, I have
      continually sought to deepen my understanding. Now, as I dive into the
      world of coding, I am energized by the endless possibilities it offers.
      Technology is an ever-expanding ocean of opportunity, and I am committed
      to exploring it for years to come.
